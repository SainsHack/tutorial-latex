split, multi-lign and align:

Align, from amsmath package:
numbered equations aligned at points marked
with \verb|&| usually just before a relation.
\begin{align}
a_1& =b_1+c_1\\
a_2& =b_2+c_2-d_2+e_2
\end{align}

split, also from amsmath,
similar alignment to align, but the whole construct fits within
equation (or other display math) and is numbered as a unit.
\begin{equation}\label{xx}
\begin{split}
a& =b+c-d\\
 & \quad +e-f\\
 & =g+h\\
 & =i
\end{split}
\end{equation}

multline, from amsmath
for lonq expressions taking more than one line,
with no specifed alignment points.
\begin{multline}
a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i+j+k+\\
l+m+n+o+p+q+r+s+t+w+x+y+z
\end{multline}

There are three commands here that work the same in the example:

    \\ (two backslashes)
    \newline
    \hfill \break
